They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency. It has been prepared for about 10 days. It is an obvious fraud.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency.

They will not help you buy cryptocurrencies. They will only ask you to provide all kinds of weird documents after receiving your wire transfer funds. Then they will hold your funds. Note that they will first give you about one-third of your funds in cryptocurrencies. Then they will hold your funds for up to several weeks. They held my funds for more than 30 working days for this reason. And they did not give me any compensation. Then when you ask them for a refund, they will tell you that the refund will take 60 days to complete. I have already reported this agency to the financial regulator.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nI am glad to see that you responded to my message here in time. Because you still did not reply to my email after receiving all my documents. And you refused to communicate with me by phone. So today I reported the situation to the authorities. So far I have received $40,000 in cryptocurrency. You still owe me $160,000. Please send my cryptocurrency as soon as possible. You have illegally held these funds for more than 72 hours. If I cannot receive all the funds today. I will continue to report this situation to the authorities.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis scam platform still holds over $100,000 of my funds and has not given me any crypto. They are preparing to give me money. I have already given them the money 5 days ago. It is obvious that they will use our money to do a lot of illegal things. They promised to give me all the funds today. Let's wait and see. I would never recommend anyone to use this platform to buy crypto. It is a stupid move.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThree more days have passed. They have held my funds of about $100,000 without sending me any cryptocurrency. According to the agreement they gave me, the funds should have arrived in my account an hour ago. Whenever I ask about the funds, they will tell me that they are preparing the cryptocurrency.
