From the moment someone answers the call, to being in touch with a member that can assist with the request is both speedy and attentive.\n\nToday I worked with Rebecca Lanefski, her knowledge in business documentation and communication skills was excellent. Rebecca patiently allowed me to explain and was able to assess my newness/understanding so that she could ensure resolution to request. Rebecca was engaging, asked clear questions to gain needed information in a way that relieved my stress and helped educate me for the future.\n\nAs a new business owner, taking on many new roles, and untangling some inherited disorganized systems; it is refreshing to have a motivated customer service representative that takes the time to ensure the task is completed correctly, and the customer has gained understanding for future success.",

I guess times is to hard so they have to take it from your kids account oh and also if you have more then one banking account watch because if you use one card to add money to the account and the next time you use another card they will bill both accounts for the monthly subscriptions.

Apple Pay is amazing as well, but this program allows parents to set savings interest rates and allows goals to be assigned. Really a great tool toward adolescent financial management efforts. I thought I‚Äôd try the trial and quit, because all I thought it would be was a debit card for the kid, but it‚Äôs this awesome program which does cost, but it‚Äôs totally worth 5 bucks a month (what they currently charge me).\n\nTry the trial, bet you pay for the service after it‚Äôs up.",

        "commentaire": "Don't trust the service. I had large transactions with the owner of crypto dispensers directly back in March 2024. Crypto dispenser forced me to remove his name here but anyone can easily google the owner to find out who he is. I Experienced frequent delays and unresponsive calls/texts during the period of using his service. He often used my large funds to fund his smaller transactions on the website first, causing months of delay for me. When my project passed deadline due to his delays and caused me significant financial losses, I asked him to cancel the transactions he's delayed and held. He THEN sends them through anyway just to make up volumn for his investors, charged me a big% fee on top. When confronted, he promised the return of the fees on the transactions he made PASSING the promised delivery date it's now 4 months later. He's still dodging my calls, txts, messages, still owe me thousands.\n\nMy over all experience, crypro dispenser is ran by someone who's not reliable, he promises the world when he wants your money, then dodges your calls when he owes you. The owner thanked me on the phone because my volumn got him investors for his business, and then makes promises and disapears. I'm still very upset that I can't locate him after my losses and his missing promises. I had all conversations and all my attempts to reach him recorded as evidence.\n\nIf you are protective of your money and crypto, and you have relatively high volumn, or you are considering investing in his business, bare in mind this is NOT a reliable man or business.",

Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what‚Äôs best for your business.

They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested). I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.\n\nBottom line: I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again. They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction.",

One of their online marketers called my phone to advertise this useless app to me, firstly I refused that I needed not to borrow, he finally convinced me. After I installed the app, I requested for a loan at the end I was not ok with the offer then I neglected it, only for me to wake up the next morning to discover money paid into my account from this app without my approval. I was shocked because I was supposed to accept this offer before the money can be disbursed into my account but in this case no, it wasn't like that. Immediately I had to send email messages to the email addresses I saw online but didn't get any response. I tried to call the fool who contacted me to advertise the app to me but his number was not been reachable. To worsen the case, a week later their online customer started sending messages, death threats, posting negative things about me. I had to call the WhatsApp number that sent me messages and this foolish girl had the nerves to start laying curses on me and my family because of a token I never bargained for. Please guys, to avoid the type of experience and embarrassment I got from these app, please I advise you avoid this app. They are thieves in disguise.",

She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location. I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference.",

I called PNC, this unprofessional woman first addressed me by my first name, second she was rushing me off the phone because she was getting off and telling me I had 2 min. to get my card for her or call the number on the back of my card. I was asking her to give me a min as she kept over talking me. I have had nothing but great experiences here but this woman should NOT be in customer service at all. I am a little nervous that I gave her my account information on the phone. She had no respect and she was rude. The call was made to 877-287-2654 at 4:47 p.m. If anything else goes on with my account I will be filing charges against PNC as \"Michelle\" would be the prime suspect.

There was no mention of converting my checking account to a different kind of account with lower fees or requirements. A few days later, I received a very curt letter informing me that because of \"unacceptable activity on another PNC account\" my credit card account was being closed. There was no appreciation for my many years of being a customer. It didn't even say something like, \"We regret to inform you.\" It just went on to express that I still had to pay my bills (of course) and if I didn't, they'd pursue legal action against me per their agreement. And so ... no appreciation for my being a customer ... no regret for closing my account ... no regret for not being able to provide a checking account that would meet my needs ... nothing cordial at all.

I have recently had dealings with Chase and another bank. When the accounts were new, checks were placed on extended holds as they would be with any bank. Now that I am an established PNC customer, I can deposit a $20000 check today and it‚Äôs available the next morning. The low cash notification is great as well as it prevents me from having items returned for insufficient funds. Sometimes I play it very close to $0 and the low cash setting has saved my tail a few times. I have never had any customer service issues when calling in and have always gotten my questions answered. I have read a lot of the other negative reviews posted here and would expect that some people would have issues here just like anywhere else. People with bad experiences tend to post more than people with good experiences which is why I wanted to leave a 5 star review. All banks have one quirk or another and you just have to decide what is most important to you when choosing a bank.",

So we come back to the states and check our credit rating and pnc had given a derogatory remark dropping us 130 points. We sell commercial real-estate so this had a huge impact on our lives. And there response after running us around for 2 weeks was theres nothing we can do for you. Sorry! We have just retained an attorney as this is a very clear flaw in there online banking system to demand a customer come into a branch physically to gain access to there account after its already been established. Many people travel the country as we do. May not have a car, sickness. Many things that could prevent this from being possible.

I asked support why this may be and instead of saying anything they just closed my account no explanation. Very disappointing was hoping to have a good banking experience but that seems to be too much to ask for at pnc",

Several times I‚Äôve asked the bank to close the account, but every time they have an excuse such as NSF balance or pending item etc. I‚Äôm tired of it. Ex moved away and now she‚Äôs writing bad checks on the account. Called the 888 number. All I get are weak foreigners who quote bank policy. Went to the branch, all I get is quoting bank rules. I‚Äôm tired of it. The only rule should be to take care of the customer!!!! I‚Äôm disgusted. I‚Äôve banked with PNC since the 1980s. Terrible service! They don‚Äôt care!",

Then tried to get our money back and was told no it was already written that way now we are waiting to use that money for three years so we do not get a penalty. This is the worst Bank ever do not put your money in this bank, they bought our mortgage from our mortgage company so we use them for an equity line of credit. It was the wrong thing to do.",

The atms won‚Äôt take payroll checks, you have to get out of your car in bad weather to go into the bank to sit in someone‚Äôs office while you do somethin Simple like cash or deposit the checks their atm would not accept. I waste 20 minutes of my life every month dealing with this and I‚Äôm done. Inconvenient, not super friendly and predatory practices have made me leave a bank I have been with for over 20 years.",

If you have them please keep your money under microscopic view because this bank will make nearly impossible to track transaction if you use your debit card and make impossible to actually talk to a real person to fix an issue. Not only will they lock your account for no reason or notice but theyll literally make it to where you can‚Äôt speak to someone and fix the issue . The list is just to big of negative things to say. Once I get my money out I will never ever use this bank for anything ever",
