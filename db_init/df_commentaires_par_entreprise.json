Apparently, if it's a subscription fee certain vendors can get around GoHenry's feature and the charges kept accruing. At that point, I asked the GoHenry support to help remedy this and they basically told me I had to go fix it directly with the vendor. So - for $10/mo I was getting limited functionality to help when cards get lost or stolen and decided to cancel. I've now switched all kids accounts to \"custodial\" accounts at my normal bank (one of the top 5 U.S. banks) and they basically have all the same functionality, plus legitimate fraud claims departments. The additional setup with the bank was well worth the $120/year fee I was paying to GoHenry.",

I understand that this matter can be a cause for concern and we always try to assist our members with these cases as much as possible.\n\nI would like the opportunity to look into this further and assist you with this, however, as you have not provided Trustpilot with your email address, I have been unable to locate your account.\n\nPlease send us an email with the subject heading - \"FAO Supervisors - Issues\" to help@gohenrycard.com, from the email address you used to set up the account and one of our team will be in touch directly.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention and we look forward to hearing from you.\n\nMorgan - GoHenry Supervisor.",

But until then, their chatbot leaves much to be desired. Clearly I have too much time on my hands haha, I'm wanting to refer them to everyone and their mother and so far I have 5 referrals, 2 that have deposited successfully and 3 that haven't. I've gotten referral credit for one thus far and its my understanding they were still in the process of rolling out the program ( as generous as the sign up bonus itself there are only winners here!)

I will continue to refer friends to this platform!\n\nUpdate:\n\nSince leaving a positive review Crypto Dispensers has ignored my recent support tickets. They advertised bonus for my deposit but didn’t follow through. The bonus was supposed to be credited immediately but nothing was added to my account. Upon reaching out, no one has responded in over 5 days. Now I regret making a large deposit and paying the unnecessary fees. It seems like their customer service has returned back to their old unresponsive ways!",

            "reply_text": "Dear Rick,\n\nLet’s get straight to the point: your review is not only completely false, but it’s also an attempt to smear a company built on transparency, trust, and excellent service. At Crypto Dispensers, we pride ourselves on the integrity of our platform, and we absolutely do not buy reviews. Our real users, who have successfully used our services to buy Bitcoin, provide honest feedback because they appreciate the secure, fast, and seamless experience we offer—nothing more, nothing less.\n\nYour accusation about users' money \"being gone\" is not only inaccurate but completely irresponsible. We’ve been in the business of helping people buy Bitcoin and manage their cryptocurrency efficiently, securely, and with confidence. We have countless satisfied users to back that up, not to mention our CDReload service, which allows users to deposit cash at over 16,000 retail locations nationwide. Every transaction is transparent and trackable, and we work hard to ensure every user is satisfied.\nThrowing around baseless accusations like \"scam\" only exposes a lack of understanding of how our service actually works. If you’re upset about something specific, we’re more than happy to address it. But don’t try to tarnish the reputation of a platform that thousands of users trust with their cryptocurrency needs, just because you didn’t take the time to properly reach out to us with any concerns.\n\nTo all readers: Crypto Dispensers is a trusted service provider. We stand behind our reputation, our commitment to excellence, and our dedication to providing secure and reliable cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nWe encourage everyone to experience our platform for themselves, as it is built on the foundation of integrity, transparency, and user satisfaction. To the reviewer—next time, do better research before throwing out wild claims.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Crypto Dispensers Customer Care Team",

They don’t properly credit funds deposited. I made three separate deposits for $500 shortly after 2 am June 30th. Only two deposits have posted. Also, even with the $1,000 that has posted, I have not been able to purchase bitcoin.\n\nIf you read their responses about why this is happening, they give the same scripted response. The company is ate the F%*K up. They sent me an email a couple weeks ago to give them another chance-so here I am, and they’re suck ass today as they were last year when I stopped using them.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!",

They were offering $25 worth of free Bitcoin on your first deposit of $20 USD or more. With that information, I immediately opened an account with them. Went through the usual KYC (Know Your Customer), and before I knew it, I was at my closest CVS, making my first deposit of $250. I immediately received an email that the funds were in my account. I will definitely be using Crypto Dispensers from now on.",

They support my industry which is considered high risk and made it very easy to get me an account approved. Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what’s best for your business. I absolutely enjoy working with The Payment HQ and of course their best rep Cesario.\nThank you Cesario & The Payment HQ for supporting my business.\n\nAdam's Ave Smoke Shop",

They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested). I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.\n\nBottom line: I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again. They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction.",

I mixed up 2 numbers on my application as I have slight dyslexia, he then tells me that everyone has denied my application…after he told me he already had me matched and he was putting numbers together. I fixed the numbers that I had mixed up on my application for him to tell me that they’ll get back but the end of the month is busy for “new applications only” so I may not hear back as quickly as my first application…fine no big deal. It has now been a month. I feel like I’ve been pretty patient and I saw good reviews about the company before I had applied. However, this is just my experience. Take it as you will.",

One of their online marketers called my phone to advertise this useless app to me, firstly I refused that I needed not to borrow, he finally convinced me. After I installed the app, I requested for a loan at the end I was not ok with the offer then I neglected it, only for me to wake up the next morning to discover money paid into my account from this app without my approval. I was shocked because I was supposed to accept this offer before the money can be disbursed into my account but in this case no, it wasn't like that. Immediately I had to send email messages to the email addresses I saw online but didn't get any response. I tried to call the fool who contacted me to advertise the app to me but his number was not been reachable. To worsen the case, a week later their online customer started sending messages, death threats, posting negative things about me. I had to call the WhatsApp number that sent me messages and this foolish girl had the nerves to start laying curses on me and my family because of a token I never bargained for. Please guys, to avoid the type of experience and embarrassment I got from these app, please I advise you avoid this app. They are thieves in disguise.",

She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location. I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference.",

Money orders need to be purchased with a debit card or cash, can't mix and match. When I called the bank they said my debit card is capped at $2,000. I explained I NEED this money for my security deposit as I am moving. They would not make an exception or authorize the $790 I needed!!! WHAT?!!! This is my money!! I am so livid I could scream. I work full time and had to coordinate the time off to go drop off my security on Monday and now I am screwed because Monday is a bank holiday and they're closed.

I needed my money so I asked them to close the account and transfer my money to another bank. their policy! due to large amounts of money they can not transfer and they will send me a check Within 7 to 10 days!. 11 days later, NOTHING! called again, she checked and said it was processed yesterday! and i should get it within 7 to 10 days! now 21 days later and NOTHING! called, sent from this girl to that guy , customer service to fraud dep. hanged up couple of times, had to file a complaint, got call next day, she said wait you may get it or apply for a stop payment, which they will mail me a document so I have to fill in and notarized and mail it back to them then they will check it out and hopefully put a stop payment on the previous check and re send another check, It may take few weeks!\nThrough it all, every time I asked for a tracking number or some kind of verification that the check is in the mail and they said they don't have any tracking number and they can not provide me with any proof other than the check number!\nNow It's the 4th. week and I am waiting for the paper they are going to send me, in the meantime I lost the deal that I needed the money for and lost thousands on interest. DO NOT WORK WITH pnc IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY.",

A credit card company takes out a double payment on my account and then they want 13 days to dispute the transaction when it’s obvious you can see the same amount came out twice. Should’ve never taken this long, which causes a different credit card payment to be returned and then I get charged $39. They are so unprofessional. I am going to cancel their account and I’ll tell everybody that you totally suck.\nDon’t bank with PNC\nMichele Hutchinson",

I am helping my mom (elderly, English not first language, computer illiterate, marginal ability to use smartphone, father managed EVERYTHING before he died) to close a HELOC that she didn't even know was open (0 balance) so that we can close on the sale of her home in 2 days. One person yesterday was extremely helpful, but we could go no further as a HELOC close date had not been entered yet. We had to call again the next day (today) via 3 way conference call with my mother. We could not get past verifying her identity. They would not listen to our situation. They kept saying they could not verify her identity even though she verbally gave them her name and SSN. They asked her to confirm the amount of any withdrawal or deposit into her checking account, and she did not understand what they were asking. They did not make her do this the day before, so we didn't prepare any statements to be on hand. I tried to explain and they told me that no one was supposed to be on \"the other line.\" I have previously witnessed my mother be unable to manage a phone tree. She was clearly struggling to find a paper statement. They let her do this for several minutes. I asked if I could provide the information since I set up and manage online access for her. They said no. I asked if there was an email that I can send a power of attorney form to. Nope. Nothing from them except \"rules are rules\". They would not even look into the system to verify our story that we had faxed a letter last week to close the account. All we wanted was to have them fax an \"in process\" letter to the closing attorney's office when it became available. Honestly it would have been much easier for me to lie and impersonate my mother to get the HELOC closed myself. Lesson learned.",

Since my balance has been paid in full PNC would not waived the $27, stating I was given a curiosity waiver in May.\nThis is how PNC treat their long time customers and Jasmine the supervisor was very rude.\nI will be closing my credit card with PNC and close out my accounts with them expeditiously!",

You don't have the ability or obviously the interest in servicing a senior person. The rudeness-extreme rudeness makes it even worse. I can't believe how awful this bank is. So many bad reviews too.

I have escalated their “low cash mode” and “extra time” glitches the continue to effect my accounts and with them even admitting there is an issue. They still would try to sneak a fee here and there. I have moved all my money to another account as PNC has done absolutely nothing for me to bank with them.
